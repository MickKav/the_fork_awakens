## **HTML Validation**

All HTML code has been run through the [W3C - HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) validator. The only errors appear to be confusion over the use of Django.

<hr>

## **CSS Validation**

All CSS code has been run through the [W3C - CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validator. There was a minor error with text-wrap in style.css, although it does function as intended.

<hr>

## **JavaScript Validation**

We will use browser developer tools to fix console errors, detect memory leaks, and verify key functions like the "score counter." Additionally, manual testing will check functionality, user scenarios, and cross-browser performance to ensure reliability.

<hr>

## **Lighthouse**

- The lighthouse score results can be found below.

## **Manual Testing**

Contrast checks were carried out. Errors were found, but the checker appears to get confused about which background the text is being checked against.
