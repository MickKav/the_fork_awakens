            Welcome to the Classic Star Wars Quiz! This game is designed to
            check your knowledge of the original Star Wars universe.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>** How to Play **</h4>
          <p>
            Your goal is to answer a series of questions about a movie of your
            choice and score as many points as possible.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>** Gameplay **</h4>
          <p>
            1. When the game starts, you'll see a question and its options.<br /><br />2.
            Choose an answer by clicking on the corresponding option.<br /><br />
            3. If your answer is correct, you'll earn a point and a message will
            appear confirming that your answer is correct.<br /><br />
            4. If your answer is incorrect, you'll see a message indicating the
            correct answer and your score will remain the same.<br /><br />
            5. After each question, a result dialog will appear with your score
            and a message indicating whether your answer was correct or not.<br /><br />6.
            You'll have 10 questions to complete. If you complete all 10
            questions, you'll see your final score and the game will end.<br /><br />7.
            The game will display the next question after each question is
            answered.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>**Scoring**</h4>
          <p>
            You'll earn 1 point for each correct answer.<br />Your score will be
            displayed at the end of each question and again at the end of the
            game.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>**Game Over**</h4>
          <p>
            If you complete all 10 questions, the game will end and you'll see
            your final score. If you run out of questions (i.e. you've answered
            all 10 questions), the game will end and you'll see your final
            score.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>**Tips**</h4>
          <p>
            Take your time to read each question carefully before answering.
            <br />
            Make sure to check your answer carefully before submitting it.
            <br /><br />
            Good luck and have fun!
